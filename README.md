## Overview

**Heal(th)!** helps you monitor your calorie intake based on your individual needs and preferences. By inputting basic information about yourself—such as height, weight, and desired macronutrient distribution—the app calculates your daily caloric requirements. You can then log your meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) using one of the largest online food databases. Review past and future days to ensure you're staying on track with your nutritional goals.

## Key Features

- 📊 **Personalized Calorie Calculation**: Input your data and let the app calculate your daily caloric needs.
- 🥗 **Macronutrient Goals**: Set your desired intake percentages for proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
- 🍽️ **Meal Logging**: Add meals and snacks from a comprehensive food database.
- 📅 **Historical and Future Tracking**: Check past and upcoming days to monitor your progress and adjust as needed.

Disclaimer! I'm migrating Heal(th)! from [an old repo repo](https://github.com/marmatsan/heal-th-preview) to this new app version. Since I'm starting it from scratch, the old repo contains a more advanced version of the app, so changes made in this app can take a while to be visible
